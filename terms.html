                    <p>We offer a seven (7) day free trial of the Software with full functionality. The trial is machine-based, meaning it is tied to your specific hardware and cannot be reset by reinstalling the Software, creating new user accounts, or other means.</p>
                    <p><strong>The purpose of the free trial is to allow you to fully evaluate the Software before purchasing.</strong> We strongly encourage you to thoroughly test all features during the trial period to ensure the Software meets your needs.</p>
                    <p>After the trial expires, you must purchase a license to continue using premium features. Basic functionality (local recording and Apple Speech transcription) remains available without a license.</p>

                    <p><strong>ALL SALES ARE FINAL. NO REFUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED.</strong></p>
                    <p>Because we provide a comprehensive seven (7) day free trial with full access to all features, you have ample opportunity to evaluate the Software before purchasing. This trial period serves as your evaluation period.</p>

                    <p>In the rare event of a technical issue preventing you from using the Software entirely, and where we cannot provide a solution, we may, at our sole discretion, consider a refund request. Such requests must be made within fourteen (14) days of purchase and are subject to our verification of the technical issue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Initiating a chargeback or payment dispute without first attempting to resolve the issue with us directly may result in immediate license revocation and potential legal action to recover costs and damages.</strong></p>
