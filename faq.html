You create an account with an AI provider, add payment and get an API key from them, enter that API key in SoundMindAI's settings, and then SoundMindAI uses your key to call the AI service directly.

                        <p><strong>BYOK stands for "Bring Your Own Keys."</strong> Instead of us charging you for AI services, you get API keys directly from the service providers (like OpenAI or Anthropic) and enter them in SoundMindAI.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>You create an account with an AI provider (e.g., OpenAI)</li>
                            <li>You add payment and get an API key from them</li>
                            <li>You enter that API key in SoundMindAI's settings</li>
                            <li>SoundMindAI uses your key to access the AI service</li>
                            <li>You pay the provider directly based on your usage</li>
